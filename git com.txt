Check for Large File Issues:
If you are trying to push a large file, GitHub has specific size limits. If you include any large files, see if they are within the size limitations. You may need to use Git LFS (Large File Storage) if you are handling large files:

git lfs install  
git lfs track "*.psd"  # example for a Photoshop file  
git add .gitattributes  



Verbose Output for Debugging:
You can obtain more information about the push command by using the verbose flag:

GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 git push origin main  


Step 2: Increase the http.postBuffer
Since you mentioned previously that you set the http.postBuffer, if you’re still encountering issues, consider increasing it even more. For example, set it to 2 GB (or higher if necessary, depending on your use case):

git config --global http.postBuffer 2147483648  
Step 3: Use Shallow Clone
If you don’t need the full history of the repository, you can perform a shallow clone. This can help reduce the amount of data transferred:

git clone --depth 1 <repository-url>  
Step 4: Disable Compression
Another option is to disable compression, which can sometimes help with clones of large repositories:

git config --global core.compression 0  
Step 5: Try Different Network Options
Sometimes changing the protocol helps:

Use SSH Instead of HTTPS (If you have access):

git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git  
Clone from a Different Network: If possible, try cloning from a different network to see if your current ISP is causing issues.

Step 6: Retry After Making Changes
After applying any of the above changes, retry cloning the repository:

git clone <repository-url>  
Step 7: Check Repository Size and Server Status
If you are still experiencing problems:

Repository Size: Check if the repository is excessively large; this may require optimizations on the server side.
Server Status: If the repository is hosted on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, check their status pages for any ongoing issues or outages that could be affecting your clone operation.
Step 8: Clone Using a Different Git Client
If you continue to encounter problems, consider using a different Git client (e.g., GitHub Desktop, SourceTree) to see if the issue is specific to your current setup.
